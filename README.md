A simple web app created to practice using React and Redux.

## What

YouTube's playlist shuffling functionality is abysmal, often repeating the same videos multiple times and not playing others once. This app aims to solve this by shuffling the playlist and then playing through that list, rather than picking a new random video each time.

The app comes with the added benefit of allowing for multiple playlists to be added, meaning you can shuffle many playlists at once into one large, non-repeating list.

### `npm start`
